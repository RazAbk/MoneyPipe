# MoneyPipe - <a href="https://moneypipe.herokuapp.com/">View Live Site</a>

MoneyPipe is an incomes & expenses personal managment app, with emphasis on data visualization.
<br>



## About The Project
The 2 main reasons why I built this project:
* Since I'm used to track all of my incomes and expenses for the past 3 years, I figured why not building my own personal tool that does exactly what I need.
* Learning new technologies, and the best practices for building a great web app.

<br>
MoneyPipe is a <a href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/">PWA</a>(Progressive web app) - which means you can install it on your device - mobile or desktop.
<br>
It will allow you a better user experience, as well as a native app like experience.
